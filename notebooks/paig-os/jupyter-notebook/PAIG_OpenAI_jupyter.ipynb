    "# PAIG - Prompt/Reply Guardrails and Observability using OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how PAIG protects prompts and replies when using OpenAI, as well as how to achieve end-to-end observability.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenAI API Key**: Required to make API calls to OpenAI.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The sample prompt is around 12 tokens, and the reply is 15 tokens. The notebook uses the model `gpt-4o-mini`, which currently costs \\$0.150 per 1 million input tokens and \\$0.600 per 1 million output tokens. Therefore, each prompt/reply costs approximately \\$0.00002.\n",

    "1. Install Python packages including PAIG Shield Server, PAIG Shield Client, OpenAI, and Spacy models.\n",

    "# 7. Write a Simple Application Using OpenAI and the PAIG Shield Client\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates a simple Python application that uses OpenAI for inference. The PAIG Shield is integrated within the application. The PAIG Shield client is initialized using the `setup()` method and is then used to validate the prompts and replies. In this basic GenAI application, the PAIG Shield's `check_access()` method needs to be explicitly called for the prompt and reply. However, when using frameworks like LangChain, PAIG will automatically instrument the code and call the `check_access()` method for all interactions with LLMs and RAGs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce user or group-specific policies, the calling username should be set as the request context before processing the prompt. This can be done using the `with paig_shield_client.create_shield_context(username=username):` syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stitch together related calls, an optional thread ID can be passed to the `check_access()` method to tie them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the policies, the `check_access()` method will perform one of the following actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the user is not permitted to use the application or if there is a policy to deny contents which are inappropriate, having unauthorized sensitive information, or is of malicious intent, then the method will throw the exception `paig_client.exception.AccessControlException`. This exception can be caught, and an alternate reply can be returned to the caller.\n",
    "2. If the request is permitted but contains PII or sensitive information that is not authorized and needs to be redacted, the method will return the content with the PII or sensitive data elements redacted. This behavior is consistent for prompts, requests to RAGs, replies from RAGs, requests to LLMs, and replies from LLMs.\n",
    "3. If there are no policy violations, the content is returned without any alterations.\n"
