The PAIG Shield client is initialized using the `setup()` method and is then used to validate the prompts and replies. In this basic GenAI application, the PAIG Shield's `check_access()` method needs to be explicitly called for the prompt and reply. However, when using frameworks like LangChain, PAIG will automatically instrument the code and call the `check_access()` method for all interactions with LLMs and RAGs.\n",
