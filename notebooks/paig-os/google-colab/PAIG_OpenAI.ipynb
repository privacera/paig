        "This section demonstrates a simple Python application that uses OpenAI for inference. The PAIG Shield is integrated within the application. The PAIG Shield client is initialized using the `setup()` method and is then used to validate the prompts and replies. In this basic GenAI application, the PAIG Shield's `check_access()` method needs to be explicitly called for the prompt and reply. However, when using frameworks like LangChain, PAIG will automatically instrument the code and call the `check_access()` method for all interactions with LLMs and RAGs.\n",

        "To stitch together related calls, an optional thread ID can be passed to the `check_access()` method to tie them together.\n",

If the user is not permitted to use the application or if there is a policy to deny contents which are inappropriate, having unauthorized sensitive information, or is of malicious intent, then the method will throw the exception `privacera_shield.exception.AccessControlException`. This exception can be caught, and an alternate reply can be returned to the caller.\n",
        "2. If the request is permitted but contains PII or sensitive information that is not authorized and needs to be redacted, the method will return the content with the PII or sensitive data elements redacted. This behavior is consistent for prompts, requests to RAGs, replies from RAGs, requests to LLMs, and replies from LLMs.\n",
