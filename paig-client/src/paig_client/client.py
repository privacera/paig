    It can also detect an AI application config file in following ways:
        1. If the environment variable PRIVACERA_SHIELD_CONF_FILE is set, then it will use the file path specified in
        the environment variable.
        2. If the application_config_file parameter is set, then it will use the file path specified in the parameter.
        3. If the application_config parameter is set, then it will use the contents of the parameter. If it is a
        string, then it will treat it as the contents of the file. If it is a dictionary, then it
        will use the dictionary as the application config.
        4. If the application_config parameter is not set, then it will look for a file that matches the pattern
        'privacera-shield-*-config.json' in either a folder named privacera or folder pointed to
        by PRIVACERA_SHIELD_CONF_DIR environment variable. The folder should contain only one file.

            enable_privacera_shield (bool): Whether to enable Privacera Shield. Default is True.

            frameworks (list): The list of frameworks to intercept methods from. This is mandatory. You
            can set this to ['None'] if you do not want to intercept any framework.

            application_config_file (str): The path to the application config file. This is optional.

            application_config (str or dict): The contents of the application config file. This is optional.

            http: An instance of urlib3.PoolManager to be used by the PAIG plugin. This is optional.

            max_retries (int): The maximum number of retries for HTTP requests. This is optional.

            backoff_factor (int): The backoff factor for HTTP retries. This is optional.

            allowed_methods (list): The list of HTTP methods allowed for retry. This is optional.

            status_retry_forcelist (list): The list of HTTP status codes for which retry is forced. This is optional.

            connection_timeout (float): The connection timeout for the access request. This is optional.

            read_timeout (float): The read timeout for the access request. This is optional.
