title: PAIG Server 0.0.10
---

- **New Features**:
    - PAIG now provides a dynamic way to fetch application configurations using API keys, removing the need for manual file downloads and making the process faster and more efficient. 
    - Users can:
        - Generate application-specific API keys in the PAIG server.
        - Use API keys to fetch configurations securely, without manual steps.
        - Pass the API key either as an env variable or embed it directly in the application code.
        - Manage API key validity and status directly from the PAIG server.
